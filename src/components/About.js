        We need a name. Maybe 'Operation Hot Mother'. Also, your knee is on my
        heart. Oh by the way, Doctor said no kissing her on the face for one
        week. I was like make it two weeks, see if I care! Do you guys know
        where I could get one of those gold necklaces with the T on it? That's a
        cross. Across from where?
